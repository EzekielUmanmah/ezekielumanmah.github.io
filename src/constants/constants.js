export const aboutMe = `
My name is Ezekiel Thawngcung and I am an aspiring Front End Engineer.

I am a self-taught developer currently building full stack apps
using the MERN stack.

My journey to web development began with FreeCodeCamp where I learned many of the basics of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Databases, and Algorithms.

I am not only a bootcamper; I dig in deep into subjects as problems arise.

For example, FreeCodeCamp covers the basics of JavaScript but I also do self-directed reading on concepts like closure, hoisting, recursion, FlexBox, semantic HTML, and GitHub/CLI.

My current goal is to land an internship where I can learn from professionals already in the industry.
